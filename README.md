# pmd-project

This is the start of my long time passion project to make a mystery dungeon style game. Now after spending the last three months learning to code mainly through the web development in the Odin Project and getting to grips using the cursor ide I am going to start with my making of this - currently my knowledge extends only to to webpage base JavaScript app / game. 

In the future I will try to learn how to move this to an actual game.
